        Now that you've learned the basics of website 
        structuring with HTML, it's time to put it into practice.
        The challenge is to create a folder that will contain
        an application composed of .html files. The first page
        should contain information about you such as a presentation
        of who you are and what you do. In this first page, also
        include an image of yourself (you can use a random avatar too),
        as well as a title containing your name. Plus, in the bottom
        of this page there should be a link that will make the
        user go to the contacts page, which will include
        some fake data. Try to make it look well and organized. Good luck!
