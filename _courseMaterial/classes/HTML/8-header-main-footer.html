    A basic HTML structure could consist of mainly
    three tags: the <header>, the <main> and the <footer>

    <header>: not to be confused with the <head> tag,
    it represents the initial section of any element. It
    could be the beginning of the page itself or the header
    of a sub element

    <main>: is where the main content of the application should
    be located. It does not need to contain all of its main content
    but at least an essential part of it.
    
    <footer>: It's very much the same as the <header>, but for the
    last parts of a section. It usually contains credentials, useful
    links, copyright related content and others.
