<!--
    HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.
    It is the language responsible for making the structure
    of all webpages across the internet. 
    It not only is the foundation for developers
    to build the structure of their websites, but also
    the way for bots to access and read your website.
    This means that the better your HTML is, the better
    your website will score in google's search results.
