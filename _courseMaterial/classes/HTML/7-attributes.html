    <!--Some elements require attributes to work properly
    and all elements can receive attributes. Some attributes are 
    reserved to specific elements.-->

    <!--Example 1:
            the <img> tag needs to receive at least two
            attributes: 
                src: defines where the image is located
                alt: defines in text what content the image has-->
    <img src="../../images/html-5-logo.png" alt="HTML 5 logo">

    <!--Example 2:
            the <a> tag needs to receive at least one attribute:
                href: defines the location the user will be sent
                      to when clicking the link.-->
