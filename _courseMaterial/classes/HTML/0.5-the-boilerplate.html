<!--We can generate the boilerplate code, it means,
the code that almost never changes and that we need
to initialize any project in good track, by simply typing
"!" in VS Code and Emmet will bring us all boilerplate
we need. In the first classes, we will break down
each of those elements so you don't have any code
written that you don't understand.-->
