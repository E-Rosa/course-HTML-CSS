/*
STEP 1:
    Since we already know that CSS is the language responsible
    for stylizing our HTML elements, we first need a way to tell
    out HTML file which CSS file to use. For that we will use a <link>
    tag in our <head> and give it the attribute *href*
    and set it equal to the path to our CSS file.
    Also, we'll give it a *rel* attribute and set it equal to
    'stylesheet'.
    Check out './1-how-to-use-css.html' to see it working.
*/

/*
STEP 2: 
    Now that we have connected our HTML file with our CSS file,
    we'll choose which elements we want to modify the styles of
    and SELECT them. the easiest way to SELECT elements is to 
    simply type the element name and open curly braces {}, see below.
*/
body{
    background-color: red;
}
/*
STEP 3:
    Now that we SELECTED our elements, we can apply new properties
    to this element to change it's styles. 
    Check out https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/index.php
    for a complete list of attributes and how to use them.
