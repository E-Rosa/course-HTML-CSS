<!--
    Now that you have seen how the development of this small website
    was made, we can move on to the big challenge that will put all the
    lessons you've learned to practice. 

    The challenge is to create a contact page. 
    This contact page should be accessible through the navbar in all
    pages of the application.
    This page should follow the design and color choices of the rest of the
    website. 
    This page must have a container with:
        1. a picture of you (can use an avatar)
        2. your name, age, city and profession (can be all fake)
        3. a little description of you
    
    This challenge is very similar to the HTML challenge, but now
    its the time to use your creativity and make a beautiful contact
    container. Good luck!
